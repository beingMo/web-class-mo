                <p>At the end of 2019, during the pandemic, many gym-goers were forced to find alternatives to
                    their gym lifestyles. Even those who could afford to invest in an at-home gym, the demand was
                    greater than the resources available. January 9, 2020, Authentic Gainz began its journey to
                    extend gym equipment to all.</p>
