        <h3>Welcome to Authentic Gainz - Cultivating Authentic Gainz for all</h3>

        <p>At the end of 2019, during the pandemic, many gym-goers were forced to find alternatives to 
				their gym lifestyles. Even those who could afford to invest in an at-home gym, the demand was 
				greater than the resources available. January 9, 2020, Authentic Gainz began its journey to
				extend gym equipment to all.</p>

        <p>It looks like you are ready to make a real difference in your life right now and
				we are right there with you! Authentic Gainz is one of the younger companies, but
				what we lack in years of service, we make up for with our research and development.
				We found that those affected by the 2019 pandemic are more inclined to set up shop
				at home rather than depend on the fluctuating certainty of gyms being available.
				Authentic Gainz would like to help you along your journey by providing the items
				you want, at a price that's affordable.</p>
