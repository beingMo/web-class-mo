"No pain, no Gainz!"

It looks like you are ready to make a real difference in your life right now and
we are right there with you! Authentic Gainz is one of the younger companies, but
what we lack in years of service, we make up for with our research and development.
We found that those affected by the 2019 pandemic are more inclined to set up shop
at home rather than depend on the fluctuating certainty of gyms being available.
Authentic Gainz would like to help you along your journey by providing the items
you want, at a price that's affordable.

About Us:
At the end of 2019, during the pandemic, many gym-goers were forced to find alternatives to 
their gym lifestyles. Even those who could afford to invest in an at-home gym, the demand was 
greater than the resources available. January 9, 2020, Authentic Gainz began its journey to
extend gym equipment to all.

Vision and Mission:
Cultivating Authentic Gainz at the right price.
